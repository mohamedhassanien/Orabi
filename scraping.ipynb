      "The first year of my MSc was a year of building the fundamentals skills necessary for almost every aspect of my professional life. Courses like Quantitative Methods gave me skills related to several fields of study, like economics and finance, helping me to read and analyse data in a more objective way. Geopolitics provided me with a comprehensive vision of world trade. Also, a full day’s work in an English-speaking environment strengthened my preparation for work in an international context. The courses were extremely useful and gave me confidence in my skills. What I also liked a lot is the diversity of teachers; they are from different countries, which really gives me a feeling of studying in an international school.\n",

      "After completing a special two-year diploma in Marketing & Trade, I chose to go abroad and complement it with a bachelor’s degree in English. After graduating with a 3-year bachelor’s degree, I decided to enrol in the two-year MSc option at NEOMA Business School. It was the ideal solution for me, and I was able to earn a Master of Science. The first year at NEOMA prepared me for my MSc courses and the professional challenges of international business.\n",
